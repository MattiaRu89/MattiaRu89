My journey into the world of technology began in 2020 when I first downloaded an Excel course to enhance my skills in analysis and forecasting. As I explored Excel's capabilities, I realized the need for a more efficient way to access and share data with my team. This led me to study SQL and Google Looker, where I developed dashboards that provided key insights into departmental trends and best sellers for the store I managed.

My passion for technology grew over the next two years, and I decided to deepen my expertise by enrolling in a Data Analytics Bootcamp. Here, I expanded my knowledge in SQL, Python, and Tableau, equipping myself with the tools necessary to turn data into actionable insights.

Now, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in retail business and management, I'm ready to embark on a career as a Data Analyst. I'm excited to apply my skills and continue learning in this ever-evolving field. 

I have a wide range of transferrable skills that I can apply and continue developing for any future project, based on my previous work experience in  management and retail.
